# Conclusion
The internet is a very complicated and impressive piece of technology. In this project, I did not go through every intracacy about the internet, but instead I hoped to cover the basics. While the internet can be complicated, its basic processes can be quite easy to understand. I hope that I have conveyed the information I wanted to get across in an understandable way.
