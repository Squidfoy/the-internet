# What is a network?
On the [previous page](doc1.md), I defined the internet as a ***network of networks***. To understand what this means, you must know what a *network* is. Understanding what a network is crucial to understanding the internet, even the name internet comes from ***inter***connected ***net***works.  
A *network* is a group of computers that are connected together for data sharing. Networks can be as small as household network, with only a new computers connected, or as large as a company network, with many computers connected together.  
The internet connects all of these smaller networks together, earning the ***network of networks*** description. It can be thought of as a tree: it begins as one trunk, but as it continues, it branches out. These branches lead to smaller clusters (*networks*) of branches.
